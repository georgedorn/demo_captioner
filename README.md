demo_captioner
==============

Demo of an image captioner with homework assignment aspects.

Setup
=====

Database is already included, with an admin user (admin/admin).
The use of Django's ImageField requires PIL, though it may work anyway for images already uploaded.  It doesn't actually need jpeg support compiled it, it just needs to exist.
